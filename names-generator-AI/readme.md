## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/names-generator-AI.git
   cd names-generator-AI
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both client and server:

   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add your Google API key:

   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   You can obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

4. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command will concurrently start both the backend server and the frontend development server.

## üöÄ Usage
